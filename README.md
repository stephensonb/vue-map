# vue-map

A vue based map viewer component demo.  Demo displays 2 views of the same map with widgets to toggle between 3D and 2D views independently.  Position, rotation, elevation and zooming can be synchronized between the two map display, or unlocked to manipulate each map view independently.  Simulated vehicles with continuously updated positions are displayed on each map as well.
